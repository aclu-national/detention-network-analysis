# The Immigration Detention Network

## Summary
In this project, we used network analysis to understand the "movements" of detained people across detention facilities between Mid November 2024 and Mid February 2025, using detention data from the Deportation Data Project. Many of these "movements" are `transfers` between one facility and another, but not all. We conduct this analysis to better understand the function each detention facility is playing in the larger web of the immigration/deportation project, including in an attempt to answer three question: where are people being sent and what are the commons paths through detention.
